# Creating a new task prompt
/ask
The task we want to accomplish is:
Create a new page for upserting Games objects. Make it like C:\Projects\sport-stream\apps\cms\src\pages\content\content-page.tsx
And add this page to the C:\Projects\sport-stream\apps\cms\src\routes.ts file.
Add it to the apps/cms/src/base-layers/app-shell.tsx file to the sidebar.

Some guidelines for the new task:
- For UI use the mantine components
- For styling use the tailwindcss classes
- For the database access:
- - Create a useAppQuery or useAppMutation hook
- - Use the database types for the query and mutation functions

Edit the .aider.task file in the folowing way:
1. Add the new task to the task summary
2. Break down the task into subtasks and add them to the subtasks list like this example:
- [x] Example for a a completed task
- [ ] >>> Example for the current task
- [ ] Example for a task

Before you start, think step by step and write down the plan.
Before each subtask, ask if you should continue or if you need to change the plan.


# Continue prompt
Continue to the next subtask. At the end of your message print the status of the current subtasks.
